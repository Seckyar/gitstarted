          <p><b>HIIT</b> is a type of interval training exercise. It incorporates several rounds that alternate between several minutes of high intensity movements to significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80% of one's maximum heart rate, followed by short periods of lower intensity movements.<br><br> HIIT workouts are usually considered both strength training and cardio workouts. They often include cardio like jumping jacks and strength training like squats or lifting weights.The magic of a HIIT workout, though, is that it will always be considered cardio due to the speed of exercise. Even if you spend all of your HIIT intervals with weights or doing pushups, you’re still moving fast enough to engage in cardio.<br><br> Since HIIT workouts are typically 20 to 30 minutes long, they’re a popular choice for people looking to squeeze a workout into a busy schedule. But these workouts are convenient for another reason: you’ll burn more calories during a HIIT workout. HIIT workouts may be one of the best fitness regimens to help you lose fat. They’re especially helpful for fat loss in those who are overweight or obese.
